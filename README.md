## How to upload Works to github:

1. go into Directory "Cteryah"
2. gaa // git add -all ; add all of new files 
3. gcam "Test" // git commit -am ; auto-tracing modified files and permit changes.
4. gp origin master // git push origin master ; I'm in origin and github is master. It means I push the files permitted previously to github.

* gl origin master// git pull ; If I modify github directly or in other computers then it's different with my local git repository. So, I should pull modified information.
